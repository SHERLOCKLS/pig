The basic code structure is adapted from the master branch of https://github.com/filick/scene,
where the original contributors were filick and YanWang2014, and some open-source code was included too. 
License file had been added if available.

The code includes some redundant modules, but can be easily exploited in the future.

Now the code is actively developped for jd pig recognition.
